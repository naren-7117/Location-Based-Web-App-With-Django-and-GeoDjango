# Location-Based-Web-App-With-Django-and-GeoDjango
Pilgrimage inforamtion Service Model
•	The main aim of our project is to create an Integrated Geospatial Workflow to understand the development of 'LOCATION BASED WEB APPLICATION FOR PILIGRIMAGE TOURSIM' .The initially chosen study route is from Joshimath to Dehradun and Dehradun to Uttarkashi . The same can be replicated to other Travel routes. 

•	In the current project we would be dealing with two tools namely Django and GeoDjango . Django makes it easy for developers to quickly build prototypes and meet their project deadlines by providing a plethora of built-in APIs and sub-frameworks such as GeoDjango provides a toolbox of utilities for building GIS web applications. 

•	In our current project we would be using .GPX format, which is an XML file format for storing coordinate data. It can store waypoints, tracks, and routes. 

•	Overall the current project helps us understand the ecosystem behind this development of web application and an integrated geospatial workflow for this would aid us achieve the end goal simplifying the various events involved in the process. 

•	The information developed using such web application aids the Pilgrimage sector as information service especially visual information service for better and reliable services to the end users .
